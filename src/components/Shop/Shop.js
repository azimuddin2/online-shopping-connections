                <h3>Props:</h3>
                <p>The Data is passed from one component to another. It is Immutable (cannot be modified). Props can be used with state and functional components. Props are read-only.</p>
                
                <h3>State:</h3>
                <p>The Data is passed within the component only. It is Mutable ( can be modified). State can be used only with the state components/class component (Before 16.0). State is both read and write.</p>

                <h1>How usestate works..?</h1>
                <p>As stated previously, useState enables you to add state to function components. Calling React.useState inside a function component generates a single piece of state associated with that component.Whereas the state in a class is always an object, with Hooks, the state can be any type. Each piece of state holds a single value, which can be an object, an array, a boolean, or any other type you can imagine.So when should you use the useState Hook? Itâ€™s especially useful for local component state, but larger projects might require additional state management solutions.</p>
